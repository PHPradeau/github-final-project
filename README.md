A calculator that calculates simple interest given principal, annual rate of interest and time period in years.

Input:
   p, principal amount
   t, time period in years
   r, annual rate of interest
Output
   simple interest = p*t*r

# Simple Interest Calculator

## Overview
A calculator that calculates simple interest given principal, annual rate of interest, and time period in years.

## Project Details
This repository contains the code for a simple interest calculator as part of the IBM Getting Started with Git and GitHub Final Project.

## How It Works

### Input:
- `p`: Principal amount (initial investment)
- `t`: Time period in years
- `r`: Annual rate of interest (in decimal)

### Output:
- Simple Interest = p × t × r

### Formula:
```
Simple Interest = Principal × Time × Rate
```

## Usage Example
```
Principal (p): $1000
Time (t): 2 years
Rate (r): 5% (0.05)

Simple Interest = $1000 × 2 × 0.05 = $100
```
